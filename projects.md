## <a name="fortuneteller"></a> [💚 Fortune Teller](https://camnguyenmeow.github.io/fortune-teller) 
- **Tried several fortune telling sites on the net, but the results were not what I expected. I code this website so that me and Dasha Taran are 100% compatible 🥰**
- **Just enter the name and date of birth of you and your crush, then I will tell you how compatible you are with that person.**
